As a `type of user`, I want `some goal` so that `some reason`

PEDAC 
1. Problem  (inputs, output, requirements)
    As a User I want to input a total bill cost, select a tip percentage and input a number of people
    As a User I want to split a bill between people and calculate a tip percentage over the total bill.
    As a User I want to know how much each person needs to pay from the total bill cost plus the percentage tip
    As a User I want to see how much each person needs to pay from the total tip percentage 
    As a User I want to reset the whole calculator to the initial state

    Inputs:
        The total cost of the bill (integer or float) 
        The tip percentage as a number (integer or float) 
        The number of people among will be divided the bill to pay
        Am event click on a reset button

    Requirement
        Divide the bill cost between a specific number of poeple
        If a percentage tip applied, add that to the bill cost and re-calculate how much each one needs to pay
        Print the outputs in a panel so the it show how much each person needs to pay from the total bill cost and the tip 

2. Examples (user-flow features)
    The user can input a number (integer - float) as bill cost
    The user can select a specific percentage as a number or float
    The user can reset the whole state of the application
    
3. Data Structure

    function eventListener to lister for the inputs
    function eventListener to add a listener to the buttons
    function updatePrice()
    function reset ()

4. Algorightm (pseudocode)

5. Code (test)

1. What is the overall structure ?
3. What elements I need to use ?


What is the smallest unit of work/problem unit that I can work on ?
How can I get it done and fast ?
If stuck : how can I zoom out ?
