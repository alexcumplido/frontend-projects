#### Thoughts
This [blog-post](https://markheath.net/post/customize-radio-button-css) based on this [Stack over flow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4641752/css-how-to-style-a-selected-radio-buttons-label) was really helpful when styling the label and radio inputs. The main concept works around styling the label and not the input. The key concepts are:

1. Relating label and input via the `for` attribute allow the user click on the `<label>` generating same effect than clicking over the `<input>` itself.

2. Making "disappear" de `<input>`. Do not use display none, that would make the `<input>` invisible to screen readers.

3. Style the label as you wish.

4. Active states for the label can be emulated based on the :pseudo-class selector `<checked>` plus de adjacent sibling selector `+`. Because of the HTML structure we implemented once any input goes as `<checked>` the next sibling element will be the corresponding `<label>`, which can be styled based on input state.

```html
<input type="radio" id="1" name="radio-rate" value="1" />
<label for="1">1</label>
```
```css
fieldset {
    display: flex;
}

input[type="radio"] {
    position: fixed;
    width: 0;
    opacity: 0;
}

label {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 1rem 1.25rem;
    color: var(--midGrey);
    background-color: var(--midGreyAplha);
}

label:hover {
    color: var(--white);
    background-color: var(--lightGray);
}

input[type="radio"]:checked+label {
    color: var(--white);
    background-color: var(--orange)
}

input[type="radio"]:focus+label {
    outline: 1px solid var(--orange);
}
```

#### Continued development
I would like to apply better accessibility for this component, looking into [MDN Accesibility Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility) as a basis material.
